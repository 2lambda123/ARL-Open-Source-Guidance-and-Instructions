# 2.0

## Introduced a new form for major reviews

Experience with the 1.x process has shown that we simply cannot get by without
forms.  In this iteration of the process, we've introduced a new form that
deals with major reviews.

## Major reviews MAY now count as much as a major yearly accomplishment

Originally, all major reviews counted as tech transfers, regardless of the
quality or impact of the release.  Major reviews MAY now count up to the
equivalent of a major accomplishment, similar to publishing an article in a
high-impact peer-reviewed journal.  Supervisors are not required to do this
though; they may choose to count the impact as less, depending on the value of
the impact.

This is a breaking change from the 1.x version of this policy, and is a reason
why the policy number was incremented to 2.0.

## Expanded explanation of how to write abstracts, and provided 3 examples

## Replaced VERSION.txt with a link to the code.gov code.json schema

Code.gov has developed a JSON schema for documenting projects. All projects
are required to use this schema so that the code.gov automated tools can find
and document changes to projects as they happen.  As a consequence of this
change, the VERSION file requirement was removed.

This is a breaking change from the 1.x version of this policy, and is a reason
why the policy number was incremented to 2.0.

## Clarified licensing structure

Whether or not a work has copyright attached depends on its source; works
created by US Government employees in the course of their official duties
generally do not have copyright attached within the jurisdiction of the USA,
while works by private citizens do. Instead of forcing all projects to use CC0
exclusively for their work, the new guidelines are to choose an OSI-approved
Open Source license that is also approved by the ARL Chief Conusel's office to
accept all copyrighted contributions under.  A notice is given in the project
stating that those portions of the work that have copyright attached are
licensed under the OSI-approved license, and those portions of the work that
do not have copyright attached are licensed under the CC0 license.  Consumers
of the project can use the standard tools provided the project's version
control system to determine which portions of the project have copyright
attached and which don't.

This is a breaking change from the 1.x version of this policy, and is a reason
why the policy number was incremented to 2.0.

## Better explanation about trademarks and other IP issues

## Reordered some sections to reflect how the policy is actually being used.

## Numerous spelling, grammar, and word choice fixes.
