This document provides procedures that ARL Government personnel MUST follow
when releasing software source code and software-related material to the
public, and for accepting software-related contributions from the general
public.  The `master` branch of this repository is the only official document;
all other branches are for discussion and development only, and may or may not
become part of a future official policy.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in RFC 2119.  See RFC 2119 "Key words for use in RFCs
to Indicate Requirement Levels", Request for Comments: 2119; Internet
Engineering Task Force, March 1997 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119) for
the complete definitions.

# Instructions

Complete instructions for how to release software and related materials under
this policy are in the document [INSTRUCTIONS.md](INSTRUCTIONS.md).
Individuals that wish to release material under this policy MUST follow the
instructions in [INSTRUCTIONS.md](INSTRUCTIONS.md).

# Goals and Rationale

Goals and rationale for this policy can be found in the
[RATIONALE.md](RATIONALE.md) document.  The information in that document is
for informational purposes only.  While it isn't required reading, reading it
may clarify why the policy has been written as it has been.

ARL is providing this policy on GitHub both to guide ARL's employees, and to
make the policy itself available for other agencies that are developing their
own policy.  Please feel free to fork and modify this policy to meet your own
agency's or component's needs.  If you reference this policy in your papers or
other works, please cite it via the DOI (TBD).

# Suggesting Changes To This Policy

Change requests generally fall into one of three categories, which are
compatible with the [Semantic Versioning
2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) standard:

* Patch - These are usually spelling or grammar fixes that do not change the meaning of any part of the policy.
* Minor - These modify the policy such that it no longer has the same meaning as it originally did.  The changes 'add to' the current policy in a manner that is fully compatible with the original policy.
* Major - These modify the policy such that the new policy no longer has the same meaning as the original policy, and which are incompatible with the original policy.

If a change request is a patch, it can generally be applied immediately by the
policy maintainers.  Other requests will require review by ARL management.
**If the request is major or minor, you MUST read the current policy in full
before making the request!** This policy was written to address the legal and
regulatory issues affecting ARL, as well as to advance its own goals.
Suggestions that would cause ARL to be in violation of the laws and
regulations it operates under WILL be rejected immediately; suggestions that
violate the goals may or may not be rejected, but will depend on ARL
management for a final decision.

To make the request, you MAY do one of the following:

* File an issue on the [issues page](https://github.com/USArmyResearchLab/ARL-Open-Source-Guidance-and-Instructions/issues) on GitHub.com outlining the issue and asking the policy maintainers to fix it themselves.
* Fork the policy, fix the issue yourself, and then file a pull request.  Note that this option will require you to execute and return a copy of [ARL Form 266](https://github.com/USArmyResearchLab/ARL-Open-Source-Guidance-and-Instructions/blob/master/ARL%20Form%20-%20266.pdf) before your changes will be accepted.

# Comments and Suggestions For Other Agencies and Components

As mentioned earlier, this policy was written to meet ARL's goals and legal
requirements.  As such, it may not be an ideal fit for other agencies, or even
other US Department of Defense (DOD) components.  Before adopting it for your
own agency or component, consult with your local legal counsel for advice on
how to adapt it to your own needs.  You MAY contact ARL for suggestions, but
your own legal counsel's advice MUST take precedence over any suggestions
offered by ARL.
