AR 5-11 MANAGEMENT OF ARMY MODELS AND SIMULATIONS governs how Army models and
simulations may be released to the world.  ARL has a clarifying memorandum
(ARL-M-5-2, Release of Models and Simulations Outside ARL) which lists which
M&S are automatically considered cleared.  Need to have a checklist item in
the legal checklist so that the lawyers know to verify that the software is
covered by the memo.
