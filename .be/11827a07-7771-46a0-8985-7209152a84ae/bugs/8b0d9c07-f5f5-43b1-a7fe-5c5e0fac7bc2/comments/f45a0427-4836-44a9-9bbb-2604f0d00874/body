Projects are required to list themselves on GitHub, but are not required to
store their files there.  For example, the project may point from GitHub to
SourceForge, where the real files and real development occur.  Under this
model, most developers would not have GitHub logins.  Given this, can we get
rid of the GitHub login column?
