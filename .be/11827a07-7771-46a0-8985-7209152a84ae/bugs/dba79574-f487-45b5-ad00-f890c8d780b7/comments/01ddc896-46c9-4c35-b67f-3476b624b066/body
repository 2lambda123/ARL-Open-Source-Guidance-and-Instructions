The instructions for the 'annual review' checkbox are unclear; make it clear
that everyone that is signing off on the review is expected to really look
things over to make sure that nothing slipped through during the year.

Also make it clear that 'annual review' means 'if it's been more than one year
since the last review, you've got to do a new one'.
